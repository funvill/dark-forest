# Project Vision

## 1. Overview

Dark Forest is a hidden-movement, information-warfare strategy game inspired by the “Dark Forest” hypothesis from The Three-Body Problem. Players control star-faring civilizations, navigating a galaxy where revealing your existence means death.

The game revolves around:

- Hidden positions
- Delayed and asymmetric information
- Emergent paranoia and game theory
- The Big Gun is an instant kill

The browser game is turn-based, uses a hex map

## 2. Core Fantasy

You are a lone surviving civilization in a hostile universe. Every movement is a signal, every resource is a temptation, and every other species is an existential threat. You must find, evade, outthink, or destroy them before they destroy you.

## 3. Key Gameplay Pillars

1. Hidden Movement
Player locations are secret; all actions leak clues over time.

2. Delayed Information
Your actions become public X turns later, so deduction is always imperfect.

3. High-Stakes Decisions
The Big Gun is an instant kill — but firing it reveals your firing location.

4. Paranoia & Game Theory
Collisions create a Prisoner’s Dilemma moment.

## Story

In this universe there are four technologies that every species discovers eventually, and form the rules of this universe. “Big Gun”, “Perfect mass to energy conversion”, “Generation ship”, and "Information rings”.

### “Big Gun”

The “Big Gun” can take a very small amount of mass and transport it instantaneously across the universe. When the mass arrives at the other side it destroys anything within that hex. To operate the “Big Gun” a very large amount of energy is required.

### “Perfect mass to energy conversation”

In this universe it is possible to master mass to energy conversion E=MC^2, or to convert energy back to mass in any configuration (elements). This infers a ‘post scarcity’ environment where mass can be converted from hydrogen to energy, then from energy to lead while respecting the “Law of conservation of mass”. This is often used to convert the mass of a solar system to energy that can be used to fire the “big gun”, or travel at near light speeds.

### “Generation ship”

With “Perfect mass to energy conversation” a species can create a single generation ship that houses their entire species. This ship has the ability to convert a solar system to energy, and fire the “Big Gun”.

### "Information rings”

Firing the “Big Gun”, or “Perfect mass to energy conversation” of a solar system, or moving the “Generation ship” causes the information rings to be sent out in every direction at the speed of light. When the "Information rings” passes over another species generation ship they can tell the following information. What action was taken, The location of the action, and how long ago the action occurred.

### “Dark Forest” Theory

All species know of the “Dark Forest” theory. If they receive an information ring of another species firing a “Big Gun”, they know that it's a potential threat that needs to be eliminated before it eliminates their species.

To move around the universe and collect energy by converting solar systems mass to energy, it produces “information rings” that can be used against you. By default every species leaks information that can be used against them. Thus all species are always at a constant risk of extinction by other species.

### Our Story

A “young” species (humans) are experimenting with faster than light information travel. They build a “Big Gun” and use it on a hex a few light years away from their home system. It works. The designation hex is destroyed, and an information ring is sent from the source (their home system) as well as the destination (the destroyed hex).

This information ring travels at the speed of light in all directions from the source and destination of the big gun.

When another species receives this information ring. They know if it is a source firing location and the destination where the hex was destroyed, and how long ago this ring was generated. Using this information they can locate other species that have used the big gun.

Based on the "Dark forest" theory. All species that detect a different species using the "big gun" are threats that need to be eliminated. So they fire their "Big Gun" to eliminate the threats.
In this story it is possible to master mater to energy conversion E=MC^2 and back again. The "Big Gun" consumes an incredible amount of energy and thus mass to fire. In order to fire the "Big Gun" multiple times the species needs to consume solar systems of their resources.

In this story our species experimented with the "Big Gun" without realizing that it created information rings. When they fire the big gun they awoke a nearby species that attacked a nearby star. Since the time scale happens over decades our species realized the "dark forest" theory and realized that this would mean the end of our civilization.

They boost their science, master the Mass to Energy conversion, then disassemble their own solar system of mass to create a generation ship to house all of humanity. Then set off from the original solar system to other solar systems to collect more mass to fuel the ship and defend themselves with the big gun. As they left their home system another species fulfilled the "dark forest" theory and destroyed the original hex. Humanity made the right choice to leave.

The game is based on their journeys from their original solar system out into the universe to collect mass and eliminate the other threats before they are eliminated.
